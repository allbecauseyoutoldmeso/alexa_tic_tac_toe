A simple Alexa skill written in Javascript.

Enables the user to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with Alexa.

'Alexa, open Tic-Tac-Toe.'  
*'Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe...Select a cell by row and column.  For example top left, or middle right, or bottom middle.'*  
'Top right'  
*'You played top right.  The computer played middle middle.'*  

...hours of fun!
