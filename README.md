A simple Alexa skill written in Javascript.

Enables the user to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with Alexa.

'Alexa, open Tic-Tac-Toe.'  
*'Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe...Select a cell by row and column.  For example top left, or middle right, or bottom middle.'*    
'Top right.'   
*'You played top right.  The computer played middle left.'*  
'Bottom left'  
*'You played bottom left.  The computer played middle right.'*  
'Middle right.'  
*'That cell is already taken...Select another cell.'*  
'Middle middle.'  
*'You played middle middle.  You won.'* 

...hours of fun!

Sadly this skill is currently unpublished.  You can clone this repository to run my tests, or if you have an Amazon developer account feel free to copy my code into your own skill and play with it (nb if you do so you will need to uncomment the first line in index.js, which i commented out as it broke my Jasmine tests.)
